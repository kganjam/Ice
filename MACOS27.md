# macOS 27 support

macOS 27 moved every status item into `MenuBarAgent`, which draws them into a
single bar. There are no per-item windows any more, and an oversized status
item (Ice's old 10,000-point divider) is discarded instead of pushing other
items off screen. This is why older Ice builds show "Loading menu bar items"
and hide nothing on macOS 27.

This branch builds on the upstream `macos-26` branch and the experimental
macOS 27 work from [jordanbaird/Ice#980](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/pull/980),
with additional hardening. Every macOS 27 path is gated on
`#available(macOS 27.0, *)`.

## What works on macOS 27

- Hiding and showing the Hidden section with Ice's button or a hotkey.
- The Ice Bar: clicking Ice's button shows the hidden items in a bar below
  it, with an adjustable background opacity.
- The Menu Bar Layout editor: item thumbnails and moving items between sections.
- Menu bar appearance settings.
- Native input for every other item. The clock still opens Notification Center.

## What doesn't

- The search panel, show on hover/click/scroll, auto-rehide, item spacing and
  app-menu hiding are disabled on macOS 27.
- Without the Ice Bar, hidden items move into Apple's native overflow (the «
  button), so they are still reachable from there.
- Clicking an item in the Ice Bar briefly reveals the hidden items in the menu
  bar, which reflows the bar once.
- Items that macOS keeps in its own overflow aren't drawn anywhere, so the Ice
  Bar shows their app's icon, and clicking one opens the system overflow.
- Clock, Control Center and other items hosted by `MenuBarAgent` can't be
  dragged from the Layout editor. You can still Command-drag them yourself.
- Opening the Layout editor shows every item until you leave it.

## How it works

**Enumeration.** Items are read through Accessibility from each running app's
extras menu bar. Items without a stable identifier are tracked by process-local
AX equality. MenuBarAgent's overflow button is excluded, and an item whose frame
overlaps that button or another item is treated as not drawn: items in the
system overflow report stale frames stacked on the button.

**Hiding.** Ice owns a blank status item immediately to the left of its visible
button. To hide, Ice widens it so `MenuBarAgent`'s own overflow takes everything
to its left, sized from Ice's position relative to the notch. To show, Ice
withdraws it, because even a one-point item reserves a visible slot. Changes are
coalesced to one every 300 ms so rapid clicks don't stack overflow animations.
No private API is used.

**Alignment.** Before hiding, Ice checks through its own accessibility frames
that the blank item sits directly left of its button. If it doesn't, Ice moves
only its own blank item with one native Command-drag. System hit testing returns
MenuBarAgent's unidentified host element there, so the drag is accepted only when
that element's frame matches Ice's own boundary frame.

**Ice Bar.** In Ice Bar mode the hidden items stay concealed, and only the bar
opens and closes. Clicking an item reveals the hidden items, clicks the item
where MenuBarAgent draws it, and conceals them again once its menu closes.

**Thumbnails.** Other apps' status item images aren't available through any
API. One Retina screenshot of the menu bar strip is cropped using fresh AX frames,
and the glyph is separated from the bar's background. Concealed items aren't
drawn, so Ice Bar images are captured just before concealing and whenever items
are revealed. Screen Recording is only needed for these images.

## Hardening in this branch

- Ice never drags its boundary without a user action. Launch and background
  refreshes leave items expanded if alignment would need a drag.
- Native drags and clicks wait until no modifiers or buttons are held and
  nothing was typed in the last half second. Keyboard input is suppressed while
  the synthetic Command key is down.
- The Layout editor can't drag items hosted by `MenuBarAgent`. Synthetic drags
  of those items crashed `MenuBarAgent` during testing of #980.
- After a spacer is widened, Ice confirms that its own button is still on the
  bar; otherwise it withdraws the spacers and shows everything.
- `MenuBarItemService` accepts ad-hoc-signed builds
  ([jordanbaird/Ice#950](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice/pull/950)).
- Probe tools that posted real input or used the private assessment-mode API
  were removed.

## Troubleshooting

Set `defaults write com.jordanbaird.Ice DebugDumpMacOS27Glyphs -bool true` to
write menu bar captures, per-item crops and their frames to
`~/Library/Caches/com.jordanbaird.Ice/GlyphDebug`.

## Building

You need Xcode 27. SwiftUI's `@State` is a macro in the macOS 27 SDK, and its
plugin only ships with Xcode, so Command Line Tools can't build Ice.

To build a locally signed copy without an Apple Developer team:

```sh
xcodebuild -project Ice.xcodeproj -scheme Ice -configuration Release \
  -derivedDataPath build \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- CODE_SIGN_STYLE=Manual DEVELOPMENT_TEAM= \
  ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME=NO \
  build
```

Hardened runtime has to be off for an ad-hoc build. Otherwise library validation
refuses to load the embedded Sparkle framework, which keeps Sparkle's own Team
ID, and Ice crashes at launch with "Library missing".

Copy `build/Build/Products/Release/Ice.app` to `/Applications`, then grant
Accessibility (required) and Screen Recording (optional) when asked. An ad-hoc
signature changes on every build, so macOS may ask for these permissions again
after you rebuild.

## Unit tests

The decision logic has standalone tests that build with `swiftc`:

```sh
xcrun swiftc -O Ice/MenuBar/MenuBarItems/MacOS27NativeBoundary.swift \
  Tests/NativeMenuBarBoundaryTests.swift -o /tmp/ice-boundary-tests && /tmp/ice-boundary-tests
xcrun swiftc -O Ice/MenuBar/LayoutBar/MenuBarGlyphImage.swift \
  Tests/MenuBarGlyphImageTests.swift -o /tmp/ice-glyph-image-tests && /tmp/ice-glyph-image-tests
```

## Additions in this fork (kganjam/Ice, `kg/macos-27`)

Measured on 27.0 with probe status items (2304-pt Dell without a notch and
the 2056-pt MacBook panel):

- MenuBarAgent recomputes the overflow live, leftmost-first, from the total
  width; nothing is sticky. A widened item is accepted only if the bar fits
  after everything left of it has overflowed, and no single item may exceed
  half the bar including its own padding. Wider items are dropped silently.
- The concealing length is read from the frontmost app's `AXMenuBar`
  (`getApplicationMenuFrame()` returns nil on an external display) and
  re-fitted when the display or the frontmost app changes. What one item
  can't carry becomes blank leading width on Ice's own button.
- Items whose owner exposes no `AXExtrasMenuBar` are invisible to Ice. One
  that sorts between the spacer and Ice's button can never be hidden. The
  alignment now checks the pixel gap and re-creates the spacer at a bisected
  preferred position until MenuBarAgent inserts it directly beside the
  button (`reinsertSpacerAdjacent`), which needs no pointer input. The
  winning value is kept under the base autosave key.
